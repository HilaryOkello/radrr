# Radrr

**A decentralised marketplace where eyewitnesses capture, verify, and sell footage — with cryptographic proof of authenticity built in from the moment of recording.**

## The Problem

When something happens in the world, the people nearest to it are the first to film it. But the current system fails them:

- **Footage gets deleted** — by device failure, intimidation, or platform takedown
- **Provenance is invisible** — screenshots and re-uploads destroy the chain of custody
- **Recorders go uncompensated** — media outlets, lawyers, and insurers use the footage; the person who risked their safety sees nothing
- **AI fakes erode trust** — without verifiable provenance, even real footage becomes suspect

The only video authentication solution available today is Sony's C2PA-compliant camera system — starting at **$6,499** plus a paid annual licence, designed for newsroom workflows. Meanwhile, **416 million people across Africa** are recording significant local events every day with no way to prove authenticity.

---

## The Solution

Radrr anchors footage to the public record the moment it is captured — before any sale, before any negotiation, before anyone can pressure a witness to delete it.

**At capture:** A Merkle root of GPS + timestamp is written to the Filecoin FVM. The full video is AES-256-GCM encrypted client-side (the server never sees plaintext) and stored on Filecoin via Storacha. A public trailer is pinned separately. Two autonomous AI agents independently corroborate the footage on-chain.

**At purchase:** The smart contract automatically splits payment — 80% to the witness, 10% to a journalism fund for freely listed footage, 10% to the platform. The buyer receives a Hypercert (permanent proof they funded verified citizen journalism) and decrypts the video entirely in-browser — no server ever holds the key.

**Hypercerts are minted in two cases:** when a witness publishes footage publicly (`visibilityLevel: full`), and when a buyer completes a purchase. Both events produce a permanent, portable credential on the AT Protocol PDS.

## The Agent Network

Two ERC-8004 autonomous agents run continuously on Filecoin Calibration, each with a registered on-chain identity, reputation score, and credential history.

```mermaid
graph TD
    CA["Corroboration Agent\n0xa934...Be081"]
    TA["Trust Agent\n0x2efa...9D01"]
    RG[("AgentRegistry.sol\nERC-8004")]
    RS[("Radrr.sol")]
    HF["HuggingFace\nSigLIP 2"]

    CA -->|"1. fetch recordings"| RS
    CA -->|"2. SigLIP embeddings"| HF
    HF -->|"cosine similarity ≥ 0.85"| CA
    CA -->|"3. updateCorroboration"| RS
    CA -->|"4. recordTaskSuccess"| RG

    TA -->|"read reputation score"| RG
    TA -->|"score ≥ 700/1000 → issue trust-endorsed credential"| RG
```

**Corroboration Agent** — polls every 30 seconds. Groups recordings by GPS cluster, runs SigLIP 2 visual embeddings via HuggingFace, and writes corroboration bundles on-chain if cosine similarity ≥ 0.85. Every outcome (success or failure) updates its ERC-8004 reputation score.

**Trust Agent** — polls every 60 seconds. Reads the corroboration agent's on-chain reputation score. Only issues a `trust-endorsed` credential if the score is ≥ 700/1000 — making trust in AI attestations earned and auditable, not assumed.

Both agents expose a live status page at `/agent` with reputation gauges, earned credentials, and structured activity logs linked to the Filecoin explorer.

## Smart Contracts

**Network:** Filecoin Calibration Testnet · chain ID 314159
**Explorer:** [calibration.filfox.info](https://calibration.filfox.info/en)

| Contract | Address |
|---|---|
| `Radrr.sol` | `0x0B02E8eC8624E7e0024979D14735Bb5F4c10B182` |

| Trust Agent | `0x2efa5ebcA68341C3f9c21d02426Bca69aEe19D01` |

`Radrr.sol` handles: footage anchoring, on-chain purchases (80/10/10 tFIL splits), bidding, and corroboration bundles.

`AgentRegistry.sol` implements all three ERC-8004 registries in a single contract: identity (`registerAgent`), reputation (`recordTaskSuccess` / `recordTaskFailure`), and validation (`issueCredential` / `hasCredential`).
